              <br>
      When walking on to Michigan State University’s campus, from either the East or West entrances, you can see the big university signs with the institution's name carved in the stone underneath it are the words “The Pioneer Land-Grant University”. This is the university’s way of showing that it is the school that the Morrill Act based its funded schools off of in 1862.
  <br>
  <br>
      Michigan State University, once known as The Agricultural College of Michigan, was founded in 1855. The Agricultural College of Michigan was founded to provide higher education to all citizens, regardless of social class <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“Land-Grant Roots: Msutoday: Michigan State University.” MSUToday, Michigan State University, 2 July 2018, msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/land-grant-roots.">(Land-Grant, 2018).</a> Today, Michigan State University is in the top 100 universities in the world and has helped produce many high achieving scientists, leaders, and scholars (History). MSU was one of the colleges that the Morrill Act was based on and funded. The Morrill Act was signed in 1862 and funded colleges similar to MSU. The land set aside for these schools helped to fund one school in each state that would focus on combining “liberal and practical” education with the industrial classes to provide education on agriculture, mechanical arts, and military tactics <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="““History & Land-Grant Identity.” MSU Brand Studio, Michigan State University, brand.msu.edu/storytelling/msu-history."> (History).</a> The Morrill Act is what started the land-grant universities.
  <br>
  <br>
      The Morrill Act set aside federal land in the West for each state to use and profit off of in order to fund higher education institutions for all social classes. Most states, like Michigan, sold the land that they were given through the Morrill Act and used the money to start a college that followed the outlined requirements of the 1862 Act <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bao, Robert. “Cover Story: What It Means to Be a Land-Grant University.” Alumni, Michigan State University, 22 Dec. 2014, alumni.msu.edu/stay-informed/alumni-stories/cover-story-what-it-means-to-be-a-land-grant-university.">(Bao, 2014).</a> The universities funded by the Morrill Act were required to provide education in agriculture and mechanical arts in order to promote liberal and practical education for the industrial classes in the United States <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bao, Robert. “Cover Story: What It Means to Be a Land-Grant University.” Alumni, Michigan State University, 22 Dec. 2014, alumni.msu.edu/stay-informed/alumni-stories/cover-story-what-it-means-to-be-a-land-grant-university.">(Bao, 2014).</a> Today, there are more than 100 land-grant universities that can be traced back to the Morrill Act and its funding.
  <br>
  <br>
      Not all the history of the Morrill Act and the land-grant universities is positive. The land-grant universities benefited from the seizure and dispossession of land from Native Americans, which played a large role in the westward expansion <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="““History & Land-Grant Identity.” MSU Brand Studio, Michigan State University, brand.msu.edu/storytelling/msu-history.">(History).</a> Much of the land that is now owned or was owned by the land-grant universities was ceded in treaties, most of which were through coercion and violence against the Indigenous peoples. MSU’s main campus sits on land that is considered to be traditional, ancestral, and contemporary lands of the Anishinaabeg people, this was acquired through the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw when the land was given up by the Indigenous peoples that once occupied it <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="““History & Land-Grant Identity.” MSU Brand Studio, Michigan State University, brand.msu.edu/storytelling/msu-history.">(History).</a> The Land granted to benefit MSU through the Morrill Act was ceded from the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan in the 1819 treaty, as well as two other treaties from 1836. There is more land that the university owns and operates on that was ceded in treaties between the late 1700s and early 1840s <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="““History & Land-Grant Identity.” MSU Brand Studio, Michigan State University, brand.msu.edu/storytelling/msu-history.">(History).</a>
