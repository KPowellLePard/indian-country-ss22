  <h3><strong>Early History of the Odawa and the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians</strong></h3>
		      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		        <p>The Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians (LTBB) is a tribe belonging to the group of Odawa Indians which has historically served as one of three groups that form the Anishinaabeg along with the Ojibwe and the Potawatomi. The Odawa, derived from the Anishinaabe word for trade, historically occupied a large spanse of land surrounding the Great Lakes until the intervention of French and European traders, and eventually colonizers. The Odawa oral histories tell that the Anishinaabe people migrated west from a place along the East Coast known as Dawnland, and divided into three groups at the Third Stopping Place, somewhere near modern day Detroit. Archaeological evidence on Manitoulin Island, the Odawa name for which is Mnidoo Mnis - "Spirit Island", theorizes that ancestors of the Odawa first migrated to the Great Lakes area around 10,000 BC. The group referred to themselves mainly as Anishinaabe, meaning “people”. By the mid 1650s, French missionaries and traders were using the North Channel as a route inland. These Europeans spread rampant disease to the Odawa occupying the area, at the same time that the Five Nations of the Iroqouis had begun raiding the area in endeavors to control the blooming French fur trade. In the midst of these two forces, a vast amount of the early Odawa people were either killed, or driven to other areas of the Great Lakes. The Odawa settled in many areas around the lakes, with the LTBB settling mainly in the point between Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. The Odawa and many other tribes in the Great Lakes area were referred to in records at this point by their trading names, including Odawa, Sioux, Winnebago, and many others.

<h3><b> Michilimackinac </b></h3>
  <hr>
    <p>One such area which ancestors of the LTBB had migrated to as early as 1000 BC, was the island which they called Michilimackinac. This area provided a strategic location for the Anishinaabeg to control Great Lakes trade beginning in the 1600s, and became the main center for Northern fur trade between the allied Anishinaabeg and the French. In 1715, the French established Fort Michilimackinac as a major trading post. The Fort fell to British control in 1715 during the Seven Years War, to Ojibwe control in 1763 during Pontiac’s War, and again to British control in 1764. The Fort remained in British control until the Revolutionary War when the fort was abandoned as the British moved their center of control Fort Mackinac on Mitchimakinak, or Mackinac Island. Mitchimakinak was originally inhabited by the Menominee, Ojibwe, and Odawa peoples, all of whom are thought to be descendants of Hopewell Indians.</p>
<h3> <b> Post European-Colonial History</b> </h3>
<hr>
  <br>
    <p>Following the Revolutionary War, a series of treaties including the 1807 Treaty of Detroit ceded nearly all land in the northeast of North America from the Odawa and other tribes to the United States government. Following the War of 1812 and the Indian Removal Act of 1830, nearly all Odawa people were forcibly removed to Kansas. For the Odawa and other natives occupying the northwest Great Lakes area, the War of 1812 brought conflict in the form of 2 major battles between American forces and the British fort on Mackinac, in which Odawa and Ojibwe indigenous peoples had sided with the British to oppose American colonial rule. The loss of these battles led to American control of the island. Through a series of early treaties, the Menominee people were removed to a treaty on their original lands in Wisconsin. The Odawa, however, were spared removal in large part due to the efforts of Agathe Biddle, a mixed French, Ottawa, and Ojibwe woman living on Mackinac island in the 1800s. Biddle was influential in negotiating that the Anishinaabeg peoples not be moved west out of their territory as part of the Indian Removal Act. She argued that many of her people were too influential in the Michigan economy at the time to be moved out of the region. The Anishinaabeg were ultimately allowed to remain thanks to Biddle as well as others who helped to negotiate the 1855 Treaty of Detroit.

<h3> <b>Ceded Land and Final Treaties</b> </h3>
  <hr>
    <p>In 1863, the Treaty of Washington was signed in which the Odawa and Chippewa tribes ceded ~16 million acres of land to the US government, in return for allowing the tribes to stay on small reservations on their lands with access to resources. In turn, these native groups retained the right to continue their own practices of living off the land. Historically, these rights have not been respected either socially or legally. Federal organizations and private businesses alike have outwardly claimed to respect these boundaries and put forth a face of cooperation, but have had a historical tendency to skirt around these guidelines. These treaties are often ignored in any case where obliging them would interfere with the plans and aspirations of these businesses and organizations, as with situations such as the Line 5 pipeline. It has come to light that Enbridge, while complying with obligations to assess the area for cultural significance, blatantly failed to specify anything linked to indigenous heritage as culturally significant, leading to false approval of the site for construction in that regard.

<h3> <b>The Modern LTBB and the Effects of Colonization</b></h3>
  <hr>
    <p>The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians currently occupies established lands covering much of Charlevoix and Emmett counties in Northern Michigan, mainly populating the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation. The Michilmackinac area, and Mackinac Island specifically, draw in thousands of tourists every summer to the historical landmarks, including the Biddle House which is the oldest standing house on Mackinac Island today, and documents Agatha Biddles efforts in negotiation for the Anishinaabeg. A recent addition to the island, resulting from a collaboration between the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians and the staff of Mackinac State Historic Parks, is the Native American Cultural History Trail. A trail along the perimeter of the island which features six stations documenting the cultural history of the original inhabitants of the island, the Anishinaabeg. This trail documents the island’s history as the center of the Anishinaabeg world, named Great Turtle for their belief that it was the location of the origin of life. The signs highlight the ceremonies the Anishinaabeg performed on the island to celebrate the changing of the seasons, celebrations of the spirits existing there, and to bury and celebrate their dead. Many of the Anishinaabeg communities just to the North and South of the Island, including the LTBB, engage in these traditions today. Despite these contributions, the area’s tourism centers almost exclusively on old American and British colonial history. Some efforts have been made to repatriate remains and funerary items to tribes which have been disturbed on the island, but virtually no efforts exist to repatriate any portions of the Michilimackinac area or significant landmarks/features within it.

    <h3><b>Conclusion and Repatriation Efforts</b></h3>
    <hr>
      <p>	The Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians has a long history and sacred history in the Mackinaw area, in which they are making good progress to reclaim their heritage and share their cultural practices. In recent years tribe members have been working closely with the Mackinac State Parks to shift the narrative that has been painted by colonizers. Their work with the state parks allowed tribe members to design and choose what material is presented to show the story of the LTBB from their perspective. This is great progress and the help of the state parks should not be understated. In addition, shifting ideas about tourism and the history of America is also helpful to understanding the needs of native populations all over the country. When visiting new places it is important to always have an open mind and listen to the communities who you are touring. The LTBB has been living in the Mackinac area for hundreds of years and the cultural significance of Mackinac Island is a sacred place that must be treated with the utmost respect.
