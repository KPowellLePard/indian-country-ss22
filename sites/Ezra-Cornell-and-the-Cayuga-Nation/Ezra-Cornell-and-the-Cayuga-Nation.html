        <h3>The Morrill Act of 1862</h3>
        <br>
		        <p>The land grant was set in motion by Justin Smith Morrill, who was a United States representative from Vermont, in 1857. Morrill submitted a bill in the effort to elevate higher education in the states, specifically for “the endowment, support and maintenance of at least one college in each state where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific or classical studies, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, as the legislatures of the states may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.” Although the bill faced opposition, it was eventually passed and vetoed by President Buchanan. Buchanan believed the bill unconstitutional and too expensive. </p>
            <p> Abraham Lincoln became president in 1861, and the bill was signed into law on July 2, 1862. The act had provisions:
              <ul>
                <li>1)	Each state was to receive 30,000 acres of public land within its boundaries for each of its congressional senators and representatives.</li>
                <li>2)	The land could be located, claimed, and sold for cash, which was then to be invested to create a permanent endowment to support higher education. If the state had no public land or if it had an insufficient amount, it would be given an equivalent amount of land scrip. The scrip could be sold on the open market to realize the value of the land.</li>
                <li>3)	All management and investment expense had to be borne by the state, and not from the proceeds of the land sale. The endowment created had to be invested at a rate of not less than 5 percent, and the state had to make up any investment shortfall and replace and lost principal.</li>
                <li>4)	Proceeds form the endowment, which could not be used for “the purchase, erection, preservation, or repair of any building or buildings,” had to be made available for: … the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in several pursuits and professions of life.</li>
                <li>5)	Each state and territory had two years to accept these conditions and five years to complete its sale and fund at least one college in the state with this mission.</li></ul>
                <p> Land grant designations eventually went to 17 institutions in existence in 1862. Private universities including Brown, MIT, Rutgers, Vermont, and Yale. Eight state Universities in Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Four agricultural colleges were also created in Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. There were twenty-six land-grant institutions founded between 1862-1879: Cornell was the only private University, Arkansas, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and West Virginia made up the State Universities; Eight A&M colleges in Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and Indiana; Finally six separate black colleges in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas. </p>
                <p> The Morrill Act allocated and sold 17.4 million acres of land which yielded a $7.55 million endowment. All together the federal government gave away near 1.14 billion acres of public land during this period. New York received the largest amount of the grant, close to 990,000 acres in the form of scrip. The total land sold was roughly the size of Denmark.</p>
                <p> Land-grant Universities, from the outset, were designed to “meet the needs of the sons and daughters of toil,” the children of working-class families who were not able to afford to attain a college degree otherwise. Although it has been said that they offered educational opportunities “for the rest of us”, until recently it has been overlooked that the profit and opportunities were created from the seizure of Indigenous lands. </p>

                  <p> Ezra Cornell was born January 11, 1807 in Westchester Landing, currently the Bronx, NY. Cornell began his career as a carpenter and then finally as a mechanic at a cotton mill on Cascadilla Creek. He married his wife, Mary Ann Wood, in 1831. Upon the growth of his family, Cornell began work on sales for a new type of plow he had purchased patent rights for. The sales from these plows eventually led him to the office of Samuel F.B. Morse who was looking for a way to bury telegraph lines. Utilizing his knowledge of plows, Ezra designed a plow to attain the depth Morse was looking for, and in such he gained Morse’ trust. Over the years and throughout multiple inventions, Cornell supervised the erection of multiple telegraph lines, leading to his promotion to president of the company in 1849. Upon the creation of Western Union company (through the consolidation of companies), Cornell received $2 million in Western Union stock. </p>
                  <p>Cornell began his career in philanthropy after retiring from Western Union. He created the Cornell Free Library, which was the first public library for the citizens of Ithaca. </p>
