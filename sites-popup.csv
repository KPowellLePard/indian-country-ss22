37.871899,-122.258540,<h3>Feminism and Landgrab Universities</h3>,<h4></h4>,"The intersection between feminism and human rights has been explored for many years, but far less attention has been paid to the work of Indigenous women and land rights and tribal sovereignty. The controversy surrounding “Land Grab” agricultural universities will be well known to anyone who studies land rights and the less-than-satisfactory practice of land acknowledgment without accountability, but not so much is known about the women who are at the forefront of this, and all, Native movements in the United States. Specifically, we are exploring the work of the Sogorea Te Land Trust, a women-led movement, and their efforts to regain the land taken from the Ohlone for the construction of UC Berkeley. It is important to recognize how female leaders have learned to integrate feminism into movements where many say there is no extra room among the complexities of sovereignty, some going as far as to claim there is no way to decolonize what had become white feminism in a way that can benefit the unique needs of Indigenous women. The women involved in these land-back movements prove that this is not the case, along with the aid of many Indigenous feminist scholars.",<a href='sites/feminism-and-uc-berkeley/feminism-and-uc-berkeley.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School</h3>,<h4> Anishinabe Three Fires Confederacy</h4>,"Through treaties with the U.S. Government, the Anishinabe Three Fires Confederacy ceded land that was used to build Michigan State University and the Mt. Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School. Indian Boarding School were a creation of Richard Pratt, who intended to create schools that destroyed native children's ties with their culture, language and spirituality. Mt. Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding was created to dispossess Anishinabe children from their culture. Michigan State University is built on the ancestral lands of the Anishinabe Three Fires Confederacy. This work is an exploration of the dually destructive impacts of simultaneous dispossession of tribal land and culture.",<a href='sites/Land-and-Cultural-Dispossession/Land-and-Cultural-Dispossession.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

We are also going to look at the connection between the Saginaw-Chippewa Tribe and the land the MSU’s campus currently sits on. We will look at this connection using information from the Campus Archaeology program and their articles on their findings that point to Indigenous peoples inhabiting the land that the campus is on. We think it will be interesting to see the connection between the history of the university and the Indigenous people that once lived on the land, and how the Morrill Act changed the history of the land. This final project could be used to help to further educate people on the topic of MSU as a Land-Grant University and on the people that once lived on the land, and where they are today.

Ezra Cornell, whose namesake was used for the Ivy League school, was one of the individuals who seized the opportunity granted by Morrill. Going as far as naming its first building after Morrill, Cornell University acknowledges its former transgressions, similar to the acknowledgements made by Michigan State University, but still lacks in terms of repatriation and real, substantial help towards the Indigenous population that once called that region home. The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’, or Cayuga Nation, now apart of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, do accept the acknowledgment made by Cornell University but still claim the former and ongoing connection to the land and water of the region. Additionally, the differentiation corresponding to the meaning of wealth held by Ezra Cornell and his predecessors and that held by the Indigenous community is distinct.","<a href='sites/Ezra Cornell, Cornell University, and the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’/Cornell.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"

We examine what resources Michigan State University offers to Native American students, faculty, and staff, especially how MSU has implemented the Native American tuition waiver. Through interviewing Native American students, faculty, staff, and tribal members, we investigate how MSU supports Indigenous communities and nations in Michigan, as stated in its Land Acknowledgement, as well as the struggles/solutions to recognize, support, and advocate for the rights of Indigenous peoples in Michigan. The interview questions include: the execution of Native American scholarship and tuition waiver, the application numbers versus enrollment rate of Indigenous students, the struggles of recruiting Native students, and personal experience of Indigenous members on campus. The interviews are based on the following literature: MSU full Land Acknowledgement, Intervention: Land Grab Universities Issue Native American and Indigenous Studies Journal, Waiver of Tuition for North American Indians Act 174 of 1976, Visibility of Indigenous Students in Michigan State University’s history, Debunking 10 misconceptions about Michigan’s Native Americans, and How the United States funded land-grant universities with expropriated Indigenous land – Michigan State University – High Country News.","<a href='sites/sofia-loreina-project/sofia-loreina-project.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>"
45.8492,-84.6189,<h3>Michilimackinac and the Effects of Tourism on the Odawa</h3>,<h4>Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians</h4>,"The Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians is an Indigenous group located in Northern Michigan, mostly in Charlevoix and Emmet counties. This tribe is one of three groups that are a part of the Anishinabek nation. The Odawa people have a long history filled with a rich array of cultural practices and ceremonies, however, there is limited information known about the details of these practices due to the erasure of colonization. The Anishinabek groups have been in contact with European colonizers since the 17th century and these interactions dramatically changed the way of life for the native populations. This project will examine the historical and cultural aspects of the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians with specific analysis of modern issues in tourism that stem from years of colonialism. Particularly, we will focus on the impact of modern and historical tourism on the traditions and lives of the Odawa people with regards to Michilimackinac.",<a href='sites\Michilimackinac-and-the-Effect-of-Tourism-on-the-Odawa\Michilimackinac-and-the-Effect-of-Tourism-on-the-Odawa.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>

The integrity on which these industries have been built has been repeatedly called into question, with fatal gas leaks and a continuous environmental toll surrounding the Great Lakes area indicating an alarming lack of corporate accountability. Line 5, a crude oil pipeline in Northern Michigan, has long been the source of protest for environmental stakeholders, notably the local Anishinaabe community. Created by Enbridge, one of the largest oil and gas transportation companies in North America, Line 5 runs through the Straits of Mackinac, endangering the surrounding habitats and water resources. The construction of Line 5 amid the protests of the Anishinaabe people poses a threat to the environmental integrity of the area and disregards the voices of the Indigenous community that resides there. Enbridge’s history of spills combined with the company’s lack of acknowledgement of local voices displays the disregard the company holds for anything outside of their own personal interest and gain.",<a href='sites/Line-5/Line-5.html'>MORE DETAILS</a>
