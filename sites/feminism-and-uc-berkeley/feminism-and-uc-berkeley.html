        <h3>INDIGENOUS FEMINISM</h3>

		        <p>Both feminism and ethnic studies have historically had a conspicuous gap where Native women should have fit. This is because many of the aims of both feminist and other minority groups tends to be at odds with Indigenous goals, because they seek complete independence as opposed to equality. Being recognized by the settler state would do little to assuage the very real issues that these communities face and could in fact be detrimental to them. “Native feminist theories offer new and reclaimed ways of thinking through not only how settler colonialism has impacted Indigenous and settler communities, but also how feminist theories can imagine and realize different modes of nationalism and alliances in the future” (Arvin 9). To avoid the risk of potentially despiritualizing and removing the key concept of Indigenous needs from feminism is a big task, but there are many who feel fit to take it on, such as the woman led Sogorea Te Land Trust fighting to regain land from UC Berkeley. </p>

<p> The Morrill Act was originally designed under the pretense of agricultural education. It was signed in 1862, with the first state to use it being Iowa. In California, the university was gaining the right to take land. Henry Haight, the governor of the time, had signed the charter which led to the creation of UC Berkeley (Staff,2018). The land that Berkeley now sits upon was once the ancestral home to the Ohlone tribe. There are still areas being found on the campus that contain shellmounds from the native tribe. When NAGPRA had been signed into place, the university agreed to return the artifacts back to the tribe they belonged to, but only 3% of the artifacts have been repatriated to the tribe, with the university still in full grasp of the land as well. </p>

<p> When 1887 hit, the Dawes Act was put into place, so that native land would be broken up and allotted to different tribes(National Park Service). It was a very uneven distribution of land, so many indigenous people did not receive enough land to live properly. Only 480 acres of land was given to each of the heads of the Native tribes, which was not nearly enough acreage as before the land was taken(National Park Service). Native Americans were not allowed to receive any land unless they had registered with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Though there have been new acts to give more rights to Native Americans, for instance NAGPRA, there are still many limitations within the legislation. </p>
