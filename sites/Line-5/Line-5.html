      <h1>Line 5 and Indigenous Environmental Justice</h1>
      <h3>1953 - Present</h3>
      <h4><em>Ovya Venkat & Saga Kinning</em></h4>
      <p>The Enbridge Line 5 pipeline is a work of fossil fuel infrastructure that has become increasingly contentious as protests by Indigenous ‘water protectors’ have brought Michigan’s attention to the potential for a pipeline rupture in the Great Lakes. At the core of this issue is the theft, and subsequent pollution, of Indigenous land.</p>
        <h3>The History of Line 5</h3>
		      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		        <p>Enbridge is one of the largest oil and gas transportation companies in North America, responsible for the construction and maintenance of ten active natural gas pipelines in the United States. The Enbridge Line 5 pipeline was constructed in 1953 as part of the company’s Lakehead System, which starts in Superior, Wisconsin, and ends in Sarnia, Canada; the over 645-mile long pipeline transports approximately 22.68 million gallons of crude oil a day. In Michigan, Line 5 runs over 400 rivers and streams, wetlands, and through the Straits of Mackinac, which connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron - two Great Lakes.</p>
            <p>Widespread concern over Line 5 began in 2010, when an Enbridge line near Marshall, MI spilled approximately 1 million gallons of heavy crude oil into the Kalamazoo River. This inland spill, one of the largest in U.S. history, brought mainstream attention to Enbridge’s environmental impact and the potential damage Line 5 could cause to the Great Lakes. Line 5 was originally meant to operate for 50 years, meaning that the line should have been decommissioned in 2003. When 2003 passed with no dismantling of the pipeline, protests and concerns accelerated.</p>
            <p>Enbridge’s pipelines have historically opposed and harmed Indigenous communities, who have been the biggest voice in support of shutting down Line 5. In Michigan, the Anishinaabe community possessed an easement that allowed Enbridge to operate Line 5 on their land. This easement expired in 2011, but Line 5 continues to operate on the Straits of Mackinac to this day. The continued operation of this pipeline and the conflict surrounding it represent the political and environmental implications of the theft of Indigenous land in Michigan.</p>

<p>we got this we're gonna get an A and have the best website this class has ever had. No. The best website anyone anywhere has ever seen because we have purple hair and that's pretty cool. We are pretty cool, and funny, at least that's what my therapist tells me.</p>
