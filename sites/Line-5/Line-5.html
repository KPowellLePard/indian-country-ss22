      <h1>Line 5 and Indigenous Environmental Justice</h1>
      <h3>1953 - Present</h3>
      <h4><em>Ovya Venkat & Saga Kinning</em></h4>
      <p>The Enbridge Line 5 pipeline is a work of fossil fuel infrastructure that has become increasingly contentious as protests by Indigenous ‘water protectors’ have brought Michigan’s attention to the potential for a pipeline rupture in the Great Lakes. At the core of this issue is the theft, and subsequent pollution, of Indigenous land.</p>
        <h3>The History of Line 5</h3>
		      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		        <p>Enbridge is one of the largest oil and gas transportation companies in North America, responsible for the construction and maintenance of ten active natural gas pipelines in the United States. The Enbridge Line 5 pipeline was constructed in 1953 as part of the company’s Lakehead System, which starts in Superior, Wisconsin, and ends in Sarnia, Canada; the over 645-mile long pipeline transports approximately 22.68 million gallons of crude oil a day. In Michigan, Line 5 runs over 400 rivers and streams, wetlands, and through the Straits of Mackinac, which connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron - two Great Lakes.</p>
            <p>Widespread concern over Line 5 began in 2010, when an Enbridge line near Marshall, MI spilled approximately 1 million gallons of heavy crude oil into the Kalamazoo River. This inland spill, one of the largest in U.S. history, brought mainstream attention to Enbridge’s environmental impact and the potential damage Line 5 could cause to the Great Lakes. Line 5 was originally meant to operate for 50 years, meaning that the line should have been decommissioned in 2003. When 2003 passed with no dismantling of the pipeline, protests and concerns accelerated.</p>
            <p>Enbridge’s pipelines have historically opposed and harmed Indigenous communities, who have been the biggest voice in support of shutting down Line 5. In Michigan, the Anishinaabe community possessed an easement that allowed Enbridge to operate Line 5 on their land. This easement expired in 2011, but Line 5 continues to operate on the Straits of Mackinac to this day. The continued operation of this pipeline and the conflict surrounding it represent the political and environmental implications of the theft of Indigenous land in Michigan.</p>
    <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
        <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
          <p>The Great Lakes are culturally and economically significant to the Anishinabek people, which refers to a group of culturally and linguistically related First Nations that live both in Canada and the United States, concentrated around the Great Lakes. The Indigenous group that is most commonly referred to as Anishinaabe are the Ojibwe people, but the term also includes Chippewa, Odawa, and Potawatomi people. First Nations is a term used to describe Indigenous peoples in Canada who are not Metis or Inuit. First Nations people are original inhabitants of the land that is now Canada, and were the first to encounter sustained European contact, settlement, and trade.</p>
          <p> Line 5 runs through the Straits of Mackinac, connected to the Great Lakes. Mackinac Island holds significant meaning for the Anishinaabe. Ceremonies were held on the island to celebrate the changing seasons and used as a way for the community to pay their respects to the spirits who dwell in the area and control the lakes, ensuring that there were many fish and that travelers could make it across the lake safely. The surrounding Great Lakes have similar cultural and economic value; Anishinaabe communities rely on the Lakes’ resources to maintain their way of life. A Line 5 rupture would destroy the health of the environment and its people by polluting the waters and disrupting the ecosystems providing surrounding communities with resources like water and fish; the people who live in the Great Lakes region would be put at great risk.</p>
          <p>James Pitawanakwat and his wife, Christina Keshik of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, own the wooded properties in Levering and Cross Village, Michigan that have become the temporary home for protestors of Line 5. Stakeholders and ‘water protectors’ have come together in that area, dubbed Camp Anishinaabek, to protest Enbridge and advocate for a Line 5 shutdown.</p>
